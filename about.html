        <h3>The Outdoors: Hiking! Climbing! Flying!</h3>
        <summary>
          The outdoors have always called to me, since I was a little girl. I grew up 
          on a farm and spent the majority of my time outside. My first love in the 
          outdoor adventure world is backpacking. I love feeling self sufficient, as well as hiking
          in a group and tackling the chellenges on the trail together.
          Rock climbing seemed a natural progression for me, and I have been at it
           for the past 15 years. I enjoy the puzzle of figuring out how to scale
            the wall.  My current loves are trad, crack and multipitch climbing.
             Hoping to climb a deert tower soon and climbmy first big wall.

        <summary>
          I learned how to paraglide this last year. It is a new and exhilarating way
          to see the landscape. Not going to lie, it definitely scares me sometimes, 
          but the feeling of running down a hill and being suddenly in flight is a dream.

        <h2>My Career Shift</h2>
        <summary>
          I have been a registered nurse for almost a decade, and have been working
          in healthcare for over 15 years. The majority of this was spent working
          as a trauma/emergency nurse.  It was a rewarding experience that also helped me hone
          my skills in multitasking, working in a team, creative problem solving, and 
          working with a diverse group of people.  I am excited to bring these skills
          with me into my next career: Software Engineering. Technology has always
          fascinated me, and I am excited to be a part of the team that is creating, 
          debugging and implementing the technology of the future.
