      <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
      <summary>
        I have been a rick climber for the past 15 years. I enjoy the puzzle of 
        figuring out how to scale the wall.  My current loves are trad, crack and 
        multipitch climbing. Hoping to climb a deert tower soon and climbmy first big wall.

      <h3>Paragliding</h3>
      <summary>
        I learned how to paraglide this last year. It is a new and exhilarating way
        to see the landscape. Not going to lie, it definitely scares me sometimes, 
        but the feeling of running down a hill and being suddenly in flight is a dream.
